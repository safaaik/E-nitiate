   		<h1> I am Safaa ^_^ </h1>
		<p><h2> I live in Beni Mellal, I am 17, and I'll be a senior in high school next year.
		My experience in AUI with the E-nitiate team is great so far.
		I've learned so much about computer science just in the last couple days. 
		The teachers and the staff are very friendly and willing to share all their knowledge with us. 
		Can't wait for the next 8 days. :D <h2> </p>
